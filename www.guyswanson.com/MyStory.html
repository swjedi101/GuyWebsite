	<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I  drove slowly for about 4 more miles of gravel road, it wasn&#39;t an ideal  road for a brand new sports car, and finally came to a trailer house and  a sign announcing camping lots for sale. &nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It  was kind of a letdown, coming through those magnificant canyons,&nbsp; to  think I could find anything exciting in this flat land covered in </span></span><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: medium;">r<span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: medium;">ock  and Juniper</span></span></span></span> with no view.<span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I couldn&#39;t even see camping in that country,&nbsp;  but the developer, Doug Stills, offered me a  good campground by the lake to use for the weekend and said fishing  would be great.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ron  Maples, his salesman, hopped in the back and I joined Doug in the front  seat of his red&nbsp; Suburban.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had never seen a car-phone like the one  Doug had in his rig, it was for calling land-lines.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: medium;">As we headed out to the rim h</span></span>is  CB kept up a racket as he stayed in touch with his construction crew.&nbsp;  It&#39;s funny,&nbsp; I still remember his phone number, ZO5-5337 through the  Bend operator.&nbsp; I had occasion to use it a few times over the next few  years.</span></span></p>

	

	
						
	

    
  
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
  
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
  
    
    
    
    
  
    
    
    
    
  
    
    
    
    
  
    
    
    
    
  
    
    
    
  
  
  
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
  
    
    
  
    
      
        
  
    
  
  
  
    
    
    
    
  
  
    
    
    
    
  
    
    
    
    
  
    
    
    
    
  
    
    
    
    
  
    
    
    
    
  
    
    
    
    
  
    
    
    
    
  
    
    
    
    
  
    
    
    
    
      

	
	

	

	
	
	 
	

	
	<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Up  by the main gate, all of the lots in the first and second additions had  been sold.&nbsp; They were pretty much flatland with scrub Juniper and brush  and didn&#39;t hold much appeal to me anyway.&nbsp; I was starting to change my  mind about the desert.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Doug  had just pushed through a road with his&nbsp; D-9 cat along Upper Canyon Rim  Drive.&nbsp; All the roads would be pumice and he had contracted with a  company to spray them with road oil. &nbsp; These rimrock lots in Addition  Three would be ready as soon as the survey was completed later in the  summer. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Then  I spotted a view of Mt. Jefferson framed by a big Juniper tree and I  told him to stop.&nbsp; Walking out to the edge of Big Canyon, I could see a  nice flat building spot with panoramic view of the Cascade Range. <br /></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I&nbsp;  wasn&#39;t sure if it was the right decision, but I gave him a check for  $100 to hod it until the survey was completed.&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, I had bought  my first new car on a knee-jerk impulse and loved it, so maybe this  could work.&nbsp; My dad had always taught me to be sceptical of car salesmen  so I was pretty sure he would not react favorable to my buying acreage  in the desert, but it ws only a hundred dollars. </span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I didn&#39;t have a rope so I decided that I would sleep better on the picnic table.&nbsp; That was a hard night.<br /></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I  went back to 3 Rivers on Labor Day weekend to see if I could get my  $100 back.&nbsp;&nbsp; Doug was excited--all the lots on the rim were sold, and he  was waiting to see if I still wanted mine.&nbsp; I decided to "Man Up" and go through with it, went to my credit union for a loan, and sent him  a check.&nbsp; He even gave me 10% off for cash.&nbsp; It came to $3,250.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I  had a new car and a piece of land.</span></span></p>

	<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;My  family moved to Culver in 1945 or 46.&nbsp;&nbsp; We went to Grandview and saw the school  house, the old cemetery, and found a place we would have loved to have lived.&nbsp;&nbsp;  It  was a lovely spot, I thought.  Then all the beautiful old buildngs  were gone!  just made us sick.  We wanted to buy a lot there  also, but just couldn&#39;t manage it at the time.  That was probably  1964 or 65.  We had four children at that time.  Thanks so much  for posting this....Betty P.</span></span></p>
